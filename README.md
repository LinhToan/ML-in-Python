Analyze loan data set using KNN, decision tree, SVM, and logistic regression

This is my solution to the Week 6 assignment from IBM's data science certificate on Coursera. 
I analyze a data set about loans using various machine learning algorithms, specifically:
1. k-nearest neighbors
2. decision tree
3. support vector machine
4. logistic regression
And then I compare their F1 scores, Jaccard scores, and log loss scores (when applicable).
